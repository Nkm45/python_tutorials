    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are **placeholders** for python objects.<br>This is how we write variables in python, ```int_var = 10``` or ```string_var = \"This is a string variable.\"```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, **10** is an **integer value** stored in python's memory and **int_var** is the pointer to this int (integer) object 10 and **This is a string variable.** is the **string value** stored in python's memory and **string_var** is the pointer to this string object.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we casually say it like, **int_var** has value of **10** assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pythonic terms, expressions or objects like **10** or **This is a string variable.** are considered to be `Literals`. This is because they literally mean exactly what they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "A 10's 10!\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas, **int_var** and **string_val** are called as `Identifiers`, because they used to identify or find the object's location in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll refer this **variables** as `Identifiers` going forth. These identifiers have certain rules or restrictions:\n",
    "- The characters must all be **letters**, **digits**, or **underscores _**, and **must start** with a letter.\n",
    "- Punctuation and blanks are not allowed.\n",
    "- There are some words that are **reserved** for special use in Python. These words are called as **keywords**. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Here's a complete list of all pythonic keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    False      await      else       import     pass\n",
    "    None       break      except     in         raise\n",
    "    True       class      finally    is         return\n",
    "    and        continue   for        lambda     try\n",
    "    as         def        from       nonlocal   while\n",
    "    assert     del        global     not        with\n",
    "    async      elif       if         or         yield\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is **case-sensitive** programming language and so are the identifiers. For example: var, VAR, and VaR are all different identifiers or variables. Be sure to be consistent with your variables or identifiers.\n",
    "- Meaningful names for variables or identifiers are important for the developers who are looking at your programs, understanding them, and revising them. This is very important when more than one developer is working on a piece of code. \n",
    "- Sometimes you may want to use longer variable names, for example lets say you need to use **\"analyze storage consumed\"** as a variable name. In that case, you can either skip all the blank spaces and join the words **(analyzestorageconsumed)** OR replace the spaces with an underscore **(analyze_storage_consumed)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens when we assign variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Tip:** All execution in python happen from **Right to Left**._\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write `var_1 = 420`, the interpreter does the following actions:\n",
    "- As stated above, python executes code from right to left. First it initializes (creates in memory) the value of **420** in its memory.\n",
    "- Python now will try to **analyze** the object (420 in this case).\n",
    "- Once it understands that its an integer object, it will initialize an integer class and then assign the value of 420 to the pointer or variable **var_1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to check the type of object **var_1** use `type(var_1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python is a **dynamically** typed language. We don't need to declare variables like C, C++. To create a variable, you just assign it a value and then start using it. Assignment is done with a single equals sign **(=)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chained Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also allows **Chained Assignment**, which makes it possible to assign the same value to several variables simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = b = c = 420\n",
    ">>> print(a, b, c)\n",
    "420 420 420\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Here, value of 420 is assigned to all the variables (identifiers) a, b and c.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, once we declare or assign value to a variable we can overwrite it or re-assign it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> var_1 = 42.0\n",
    ">>> print(var_1)\n",
    "42.0\n",
    ">>>\n",
    ">>> var_1 = \"This is a string.\"\n",
    ">>> print(var_1)\n",
    "This is a string.\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```"
