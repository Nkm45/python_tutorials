    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\\), _\"Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it into smaller understandable bits - \n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpreted language\n",
    "    - Interpreting languages are the one which executes **line by line**.\n",
    "    - They don't compile, they just execute code.\n",
    "    - Python, Ruby, JS, etc are examples of Interpreting language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- High-level language\n",
    "    - High-level language (HLL) means **human understandable** language in layman terms.\n",
    "    - They use common english words to describe their functions (example: join, import, property, etc...)\n",
    "    - Python, C, C++, Java, etc are examples of High-level language.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- General-purpose language\n",
    "    - General-purpose programming languages are the ones **which are used in wide applications** across multiple domain.\n",
    "    - Python, C, C++, Go, etc are examples of General-purpose language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why to use Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why not? - It's free and kinda **open-source**.\n",
    "    - Best way to get started with programming is to learn from and contribute into an Open-Source community.\n",
    "    - Huge python based projects fall under open-source umbrella.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's **easy** to learn.\n",
    "    - In UK, Python is taught as the primary programming language for University students at least in some of the Northern Unis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It covers most of CS fundamentals (OOP, Design Patterns, etc...)\n",
    "    - Python is built upon many Computer science fundamentals and has support for wide variety of CS algorithms (for example: Bubble sort)\n",
    "    - Python is an **Object oriented programming** language, so it revolves around the concepts of Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, etc...\n",
    "    - Python can be also used for building and visualizing some abstracted concepts like Design patterns (Singleton design pattern).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's one of the **mainstream languages** of 2020.\n",
    "    - Python has been one of the most trending programming language for couple of years now because of breakthrough in domains of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.\n",
    "    - Commonly used applications (unlocking phone, filtering messages/mail) have roots in Python.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Wide variety of applications (programs) can be built using Python (Not entirely true).\n",
    "    - As Python is an general-purpose programming language, it provides frameworks for building applications in another domain.\n",
    "    - Instagram being a website (web-app) was built on Django. Django is a web development framework built with Python. Pinterest also has a similar back story.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is used by many tech giants like Google, Facebook, NASA, etc.\n",
    "    - Google and Facebook are infamous for their AIs. Their AIs are backed by many programming frameworks. Python is one of them.\n",
    "    - Google Brain's **TensorFlow** is one of best deep learning frameworks in the industry.\n",
    "    - Facebook backed **PyTorch** is an another deep learning framework which is very simple to learn and follow along.\n",
    "    - Both are built on/for Python (along with dependencies with C++ and Cython)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Many more...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to get started with Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Best & most recommended way\n",
    "    - Using **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp15jyylSEQ)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Naive way\n",
    "    - Most naive to get started with Python is to visit **[Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**.\n",
    "    - This will provide you with vanilla Python Shell and an IDLE (place to write code).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a distribution\n",
    "    - If you want to have no fuss during the installation visit **[Anaconda's website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using Jupyter Notebook (Best way for beginners)\n",
    "    - Using **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6aOqkmrrb4)**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Using Google Colab (Best & quickest way to get familiar with Cloud)\n",
    "    - Using **[Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Some tips* about Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Everything is an object in Python.**\n",
    "- Since Python is an interpreted language, its **slower** than it's compiling cousins like C, C++.\n",
    "- Python strictly follows concepts of OOP i.e Object Oriented Programming.\n",
    "- Python is a **dynamic language**.\n",
    "- Python 3.x + is the way to go as Python 2.x has officially reached EOL (End of Life).\n",
    "- Python doesn't actively support **access modifiers** (it does, but theoretically).\n",
    "- Python follows **precedences** (BODMAS/PEDMAS).\n",
    "- Python uses indentations for denoting the block of code (scope of code).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Like every programming language, Python also has some rules of writing code. These rules are called as **Syntax**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some common rules while writing Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "- For displaying values we use **print()**.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "print(\"This is how we print messages/values on screen.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anything and everything in **\" \"** or **' '** or **''' '''*** is considered to be a string.\n",
    "    - Example of a strings in Python\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "str_1 = 'This is a string.'\n",
    "str_2 = \"This is also a string.\"\n",
    "str_3 = \"\"\"This is also considered to be a string.\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "    - **Never** use combination of both quotes while writing a string.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "str_1 = \"This is not allowed in Python.'\n",
    "str_2 = '''This is also not allowed.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "     \n",
    "- For denoting floating point numbers or floats in general we use decimal point **(.)**.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "float_1 = 4.0\n",
    "float_2 = 4.1e+420\n",
    "float_3 = -5.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- For executing any **block of code**, we indent them.\n",
    "    - These blocks of code could be a loop, function or a class.\n",
    "    - Loops look like this\n",
    "        - For loops\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "    for idx in range(15):\n",
    "              print(idx)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "        - While loops\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "              print(\"This is an infinite loop.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Functions look like this\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "def function_name():\n",
    "          print(\"This is how functions are written.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Classes look like this\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "class ClassName():\n",
    "         print(\"This is a class in python.\")\n",
    "```"
