    "# Datatypes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Datatypes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) are the one of the fundamental concepts in **computer science**.<br>In simple terms it means **type of data**. Now this data is often referred as an **object** in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most primitive or basic types of python [**built-in**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#built-in-types) objects are numeric type ([**int**/**float**/**complex**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#numeric-types-int-float-complex)), strings ([**str**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#text-sequence-type-str)), lists ([**list**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#lists)), dictionaries ([**dict**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#mapping-types)), sets ([**set**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#set-types-set-frozenset)), tuples ([**tuple**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#tuples)) and booleans ([**bool**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#boolean-values)). Datatypes mainly help python interpreter to understand the type of object it is working with and so it prepares the interpreter to be ready to execute a particular operation on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before understanding Datatypes, we need to understand type of data (**objects**) in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, objects come in all shapes and sizes.<br>\n",
    "If you want to understand datatypes my way, we'll classify the data into **two** major types: **Single type** and **Containers type** data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Single type data (object) is a **single entity** assigned to a variable. Strings, Numbers, NoneType ([**None**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html?highlight=nonetype#None)), Boolean ([**bool**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)), etc are examples of Single type data. We can consider them as **constants** or [**Literals**](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?commit=f59d18d2eb0a7b939a8e53bfdfe35c20ae48536f&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f78616d6573332f707974686f6e5f7475746f7269616c732f663539643138643265623061376239333961386535336266646665333563323061653438353336662f6261736963732f303230305f7661726961626c65735f696e5f707974686f6e2e6970796e62&nwo=xames3%2Fpython_tutorials&path=basics%2F0200_variables_in_python.ipynb&repository_id=283241123&repository_type=Repository#Introduction). Read more here about [**built-in constants**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html?highlight=nonetype#built-in-constants) in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings (str)\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, strings are [**immutable**] sequences or collections of **characters**. Strings are what I like to call, \"**Kachha Limbu**\" in python. It behaves like both Single Type and a Container Type object. Strings are often referred as **Text Sequence Type** as they are literally a sequence (collection) of **characters** or **texts**. Unlike C, in python we don't have a dedicated **char** datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything and everything wrapped in pair of either single quotes (**'like this'**), double quotes (**\"or like this\"**) or even triple quotes (**'''or even like this'''**) and (**\"\"\"this too...sigh\"\"\"**) is considered as a String object. Triple quotes are often used for writing string object that span over multiple lines. String objects can have one or multiple characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Single quotes\n",
    "'This is a string with single quotes.'\n",
    "# These quotes are useful for writing strings which use (\"\") in statements.\n",
    "'I am not able to \"see him\".'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Double quotes\n",
    "\"This is a string with double quotes.\"\n",
    "# These quotes are useful for writing strings which use apostrophe (') in statements.\n",
    "\"Of course you can't see him, he's John Cena!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Triple quotes\n",
    "'''This is a string with triple single quotes.'''\n",
    "# These are helpful for writing long paragraphs or multi-line statements.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "I thought this is good example for displaying\n",
    "Multi-line statements but turns out it's not!\n",
    "\n",
    "You guys have a better suggestion?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numbers (int/float/complex)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three distinct numeric types: **integers**, **floating point** numbers, and **complex** numbers. In addition, Booleans are a subtype (child) of integers. Integers have **unlimited precision**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers are created by numeric literals (constants **0-9**). Numeric literals containing a decimal point (**.**) or an exponent sign (**e**) yield floating point numbers. Adding **'j'** or **'J'** to a numeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real part) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with real and imaginary parts. They support all sort of arithmetics.

    "These are few ways of representing Integers in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "var_1 = 69              # Unsigned int\n",
    "\n",
    "var_2 = -69             # Signed int\n",
    "\n",
    "var_3 = 69_000_000      # Integer with commas (69,000,000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are few ways of representing Floats in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "var_1 = 69.0            # Unsigned float\n",
    "\n",
    "var_2 = -69.0           # Signed float\n",
    "\n",
    "var_3 = 69_000_000.420  # Float with commas (69,000,000.420)\n",
    "\n",
    "var_4 = 6.9e+8          # Exponents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we represent Complex in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "var_1 = 69j             # Only imaginary part\n",
    "\n",
    "var_2 = 420 + 69j       # With real part\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### None (NoneType)\n",
    "\n",
    "None usually represents the absence of a value or [**null**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#the-null-object). None is a **singleton** (fancy advance concept that we will explore later). Python uses the keyword **None** to define null objects and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we write None:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xa = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** None resets the variable. It doesn't **delete** it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Booleans (bool)\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean values are the two literals (constant) objects **False** and **True**. They are used to represent truth values. Also Booleans are subclass (child class) of Integers, hence in python 0 and 1 can also be resolved or treated as False and True respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xa_is_god = True\n",
    "\n",
    "xa_is_mortal = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Container Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Container objects in this context means any python object that holds multiple elements. In simple terms, containers are exactly what it sounds like - they contain **elements**. These containers are special and play very important role in python's ecosystem. Strings, Sequences ([**list**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#list)/[**tuple**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#tuple)), Dictionaries ([**dict**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#mapping-types-dict)) and Sets ([**set**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#set-types)), etc are examples of Container type data."
