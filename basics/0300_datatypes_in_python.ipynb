    "# Datatypes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Datatypes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) are the one of the fundamental concepts in **computer science**.<br>In simple terms it means **type of data**. Now this data is often referred as an **object** in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we'll see how these datatypes **look** like and can be **created** in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most primitive or basic types of python [**built-in**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#built-in-types) objects are numeric type ([**int**/**float**/**complex**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#numeric-types-int-float-complex)), strings ([**str**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#text-sequence-type-str)), lists ([**list**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#lists)), dictionaries ([**dict**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#mapping-types)), sets ([**set**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#set-types-set-frozenset)), tuples ([**tuple**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#tuples)) and booleans ([**bool**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#boolean-values)). Datatypes mainly help python interpreter to understand the type of object it is working with and so it prepares the interpreter to be ready to execute a particular operation on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before understanding Datatypes, we need to understand type of data (**objects**) in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, objects come in all shapes and sizes.<br>\n",
    "If you want to understand datatypes my way, we'll classify the data into **two** major types: **Single type** and **Containers type** data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Single type data (object) is a **single entity** assigned to a variable. Strings, Numbers, NoneType ([**None**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html?highlight=nonetype#None)), Boolean ([**bool**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)), etc are examples of Single type data. We can consider them as **constants** or [**Literals**](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?commit=f59d18d2eb0a7b939a8e53bfdfe35c20ae48536f&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f78616d6573332f707974686f6e5f7475746f7269616c732f663539643138643265623061376239333961386535336266646665333563323061653438353336662f6261736963732f303230305f7661726961626c65735f696e5f707974686f6e2e6970796e62&nwo=xames3%2Fpython_tutorials&path=basics%2F0200_variables_in_python.ipynb&repository_id=283241123&repository_type=Repository#Introduction). Read more here about [**built-in constants**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html?highlight=nonetype#built-in-constants) in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings (str)\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, strings are [**immutable**] sequences or collections of **characters**. Strings are what I like to call, \"**Kachha Limbu**\" in python. It behaves like both Single Type and a Container Type object. Strings are often referred as **Text Sequence Type** as they are literally a sequence (collection) of **characters** or **texts**. Unlike C, in python we don't have a dedicated **char** datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything and everything wrapped in pair of either single quotes (**'like this'**), double quotes (**\"or like this\"**) or even triple quotes (**'''or even like this'''**) and (**\"\"\"this too...sigh\"\"\"**) is considered as a String object. Triple quotes are often used for writing string object that span over multiple lines. String objects can have one or multiple characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Single quotes\n",
    "'This is a string with single quotes.'\n",
    "# These quotes are useful for writing strings which use (\"\") in statements.\n",
    "'I am not able to \"see him\".'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Double quotes\n",
    "\"This is a string with double quotes.\"\n",
    "# These quotes are useful for writing strings which use apostrophe (') in statements.\n",
    "\"Of course you can't see him, he's John Cena!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Triple quotes\n",
    "'''This is a string with triple single quotes.'''\n",
    "# These are helpful for writing long paragraphs or multi-line statements.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "I thought this is good example for displaying\n",
    "Multi-line statements but turns out it's not!\n",
    "\n",
    "You guys have a better suggestion?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numbers (int/float/complex)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three distinct numeric types: **integers**, **floating point** numbers, and **complex** numbers. In addition, Booleans are a subtype (child) of integers. Integers have **unlimited precision**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers are created by numeric literals (constants **0-9**). Numeric literals containing a decimal point (**.**) or an exponent sign (**e**) yield floating point numbers. Adding **'j'** or **'J'** to a numeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real part) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with real and imaginary parts. They support all sort of arithmetics. Please see [**this**](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?commit=f59d18d2eb0a7b939a8e53bfdfe35c20ae48536f&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f78616d6573332f707974686f6e5f7475746f7269616c732f663539643138643265623061376239333961386535336266646665333563323061653438353336662f6261736963732f303230315f6f7065726174696f6e735f6f6e5f7661726961626c65732e6970796e62&nwo=xames3%2Fpython_tutorials&path=basics%2F0201_operations_on_variables.ipynb&repository_id=283241123&repository_type=Repository#Operations-on-Variables) for quick reference.\n",

    "These are few ways of representing Integers in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "var_1 = 69              # Unsigned int\n",
    "\n",
    "var_2 = -69             # Signed int\n",
    "\n",
    "var_3 = 69_000_000      # Integer with commas (69,000,000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are few ways of representing Floats in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "var_1 = 69.0            # Unsigned float\n",
    "\n",
    "var_2 = -69.0           # Signed float\n",
    "\n",
    "var_3 = 69_000_000.420  # Float with commas (69,000,000.420)\n",
    "\n",
    "var_4 = 6.9e+8          # Exponents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we represent Complex in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "var_1 = 69j             # Only imaginary part\n",
    "\n",
    "var_2 = 420 + 69j       # With real part\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### None (NoneType)\n",
    "\n",
    "None usually represents the absence of a value or [**null**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#the-null-object). None is a **singleton** (fancy advance concept that we will explore later). Python uses the keyword **None** to define null objects and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we write None:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xa = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** None resets the variable. It doesn't **delete** it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Booleans (bool)\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean values are the two literals (constant) objects **False** and **True**. They are used to represent truth values. Also Booleans are subclass (child class) of Integers, hence in python 0 and 1 can also be resolved or treated as False and True respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xa_is_god = True\n",
    "\n",
    "xa_is_mortal = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Container Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Container objects in this context means any python object that holds multiple elements. In simple terms, containers are exactly what it sounds like - they contain **elements**. These containers are special and play very important role in python's ecosystem. Strings, Sequences ([**list**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#list)/[**tuple**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#tuple)), Dictionaries ([**dict**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#mapping-types-dict)) and Sets ([**set**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#set-types)) etc are examples of Container type data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lists (list)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are probably one of the most used and simplest datatype (data-structure) in python which is used to **contain** (hence a container) or store or hold a **list** of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, a \"*List is an **ordered** collection of elements.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But what does **ordered** means? Ordered means having **index** and retaining the **order** of creation in layman terms.<br>Lists have [**indexes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_notation#In_computing) or **index notations**. Hence, we can access elements of a list using its **index** position. In python, like most of the programming languages the index starts with **zero**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are usually written with **\"\\[\\ir]\"** (square brackets) in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Empty list\n",
    "xa = []\n",
    "\n",
    "# List with single element\n",
    "xa = [\"Srusthi\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of all string elements\n",
    "xa = [\"Shailesh\", \"Mini\", \"Shivam\", \"Sagar\", \"Pranali\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of elements with different datatypes and duplicates\n",
    "xa = [1, True, 4.0, 5, \"6\", None, _, 4.0, \"Karnik\", None]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can hold virtually any valid python object and need not to be homogeneous (same elements). There are **no restrictions** on having number of elements in a list but lists are always **definite**! Meaning all the elements in the **\"\\[ \\]\"** (square brackets) seperated by **\",\"** (commas) will be part of the list. There can be an empty list (zero elements), there can be list with only one element or there could be multiple elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "A list could nest another list too.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuple (tuple)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Lists, Tuples are another **Sequence Type** data-structure (datatype) in python. If you understand lists, you'll be able to understand tuples in no time! Just like lists again, tuples also have **indexes** hence you can access elements of a tuple like a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are usually written with **\"()\"** (round brackets) in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Empty tuple\n",
    "xa = ()\n",
    "\n",
    "# List with single element\n",
    "xa = (\"Ashish\",) # Comma is very important here\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple of all string elements\n",
    "xa = (\"DOCUMENT SAVER\", \"CR07\", \"Game Player\", \"XA\", \"Shubham\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of elements with different datatypes and duplicates\n",
    "xa = (None, _, 1, \"DragonBall Z\", 42.0, tuple(), \"DragonBall Z\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple can also hold virtually any valid python object and need not to be homogeneous (same elements). Similarly, there are **no restrictions** on having number of elements in a tuple and are **definite** too. There can be an empty tuple (zero elements), there can be list with only one element (intermediate level stuff) or there could be multiple elements. A tuple could nest another tuple too just like a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Tuples are **faster** than a list in terms of program execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dictionary (dict)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are **unordered** collection of a **key-value** pairs. Dictionaries are unordered means, it doesn't support indexing and the order of the **\"elements\"** are not retained after the creation. This is not completely **true**! Python 3.6 and up **retains** a dictionary's order. Dictionaries are created using **{}** (curly brackets) in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some important things to note before creating a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A dictionary needs to have a key-value pair.\n",
    "- The dictionary keys must be unique (not a compulsion though).\n",
    "- Key must be an immutable object (more on that in next session).\n",
    "- A dictionary can be empty.\n",
    "- Dictionary's value can hold nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Empty dictionary\n",
    "xa = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dictionary with single key-value pair\n",
    "xa = {\"name\": \"XA\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dictionary with multiple key-value pairs\n",
    "xa = {\"name\": \"XA\", \"age\" : 25, \"gender\": \"Male\", \"type\": \"God-Tier\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here for the last example, **\"name\"** is the key whose paired value is **\"XA\"**. Similarly, for **\"age\"** its respective value is **25** (integer) and so on. This tells us value of a key-value pair of a dictionary object could be of any datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set (set)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are **unordered** collection of **unique** elements. These are unordered too, meaning the elements of a set cannot be accessed using an **index**. These is for a special reason. Since, a **set** is a collection of **unique** elements the duplicates are ignored and so is their **index**. It would be difficult to visualize this so its better to test it out by ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set **looks like** combination of a sequence (list/tuple) and a dictionary. Just like a Dictionary, sets are created using **{}** (curly brackets) with elements seperated by commas (**,**) in python but you **cannot** create an empty set using this method. Since a pair of curly brackets **{}** resembles an empty dictionary, we need to use the **built-in** set type for creating an empty set.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Empty set\n",
    "xa = set()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set with single element\n",
    "xa = {\"Shivam\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set of elements with different datatypes and duplicates\n",
    "xa = {True, \"Game Player\", 42.0, \"Daulat\", 69, range(10), \"Daulat\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here for the last example, we can see there are **duplicates**. By definition, we cannot have duplicates in sets and hence when you print the output of last example, you'll get something like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(xa)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output of last example\n",
    "{True, \"Game Player\", 42.0, \"Daulat\", 69, range(10)}\n",
    "```"
