# Loops in Python

**[Loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOOP_(programming_language))** are yet another fundamental concepts in **computer science**. In simple terms it means to **iterate** or **repeat** something.

**Note:** To understand loops properly, it is presumed that you know little bit about **[Containers](https://github.com/xames3/python_tutorials/blob/master/basics/0300_datatypes_in_python.md#container-type)**.

In programming, usually all statements are executed **sequentially** i.e. line by line. But many times we come across instances wherein we need to repeat the execution multiple times. Loops come in handy during those situations. Most of the programming languages have the concept of **loops**. They help the developer to reduce the efforts for doing repetitive work. Essentially, loops are a **[control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow)** structure which deals with **iterations**.

By definition, *Repetitive execution of the same block of code is called as **looping** or **iterations**.*

These are usually called as **[Compound](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html)** statements as the statements or the code spans multiple lines. While (no pun intended) there are various types of loops in Python but, according to me loops could be classified into **two** simple types: **[Iterative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration#Computing)** loop and **[Conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_loop)** loop.

## Iterative Loop

Iterative loops are the structures (**[syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics)**) that repeats till it gets exhausted. Means **iterative** loops run till all the elements from the **[containers](https://github.com/xames3/python_tutorials/blob/master/basics/0300_datatypes_in_python.md#container-type)** are processed.

In Python, we classify iterative loops into **two** types: **[for](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for)** loop and **[while](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while)** loop.

### For loop

For loop is the most basic and common type of loop in programming. They are used for iterating over a **[container](https://github.com/xames3/python_tutorials/blob/master/basics/0300_datatypes_in_python.md#container-type)** or **sequence**. For loops are usually used to iterate upto a **definite** range. Hence these are
