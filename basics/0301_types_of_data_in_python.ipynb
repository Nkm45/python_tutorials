    "# Types of Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in python is an **object** and so are the datatypes, they can be either **Mutable** or **Immutable**.\n",
    "This classification of datatype is a classical distinguishing factor in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Please read [**this**](https://medium.com/@meghamohan/mutable-and-immutable-side-of-python-c2145cf72747) post as it does a better job of explaining the Mutable and Immutable objects in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Container** types like **list**, **dict** and **set** are all **mutable** objects whereas **Single** type are all **immutable** objects along one container type, **tuple**. So even though its a container **tuples** are **immutable**. So now we know which python objects are mutable and which aren't.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what the heck are **\"Mutable\"** and **\"Immutable\"** \"things\"?!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The descriptions of the Mutable and Immutable objects are intended for the **beginners** only.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, **Mutable** objects (containers) are ones whose sequences can be altered or changed after their creation.<br>Now lets break it down into smaller digestable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, Mutable objects are those python objects whose **sequences**... **WAIT!**\n",
    "\n",
    "What are sequences? Sequence means the way the elements in a container have been written or arranged. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List is a Container (mutable object)\n",
    "xa = [1, \"XA\", 69.0, {\"this is a set object nested in a list\"}]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the created list has indexes starting with **0** where index position of integer **1** is **0**, index position of string object **\"XA\"** is **1** and so on. These indexes tell us that **\"XA\"** comes after **1** because of its index position and are hence in an increasing **Sequence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Mutable objects are those python objects whose sequences can be **altered** or **changed**...\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# We created a list\n",
    "xa = [1, \"XA\", 69.0, {\"this is a set object nested in a list\"}]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wrote some fancy python code and tried to modify the above list\n",
    "...\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "# And later we got this -\n",
    "xa = [1, \"XAMES3\", 69.0, {\"this is a set object nested in a list\"}]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we somehow (we'll see this later) updated or modified the string object **\"XA\"** to **\"XAMES3\"**. What it means is we can **add** or **re-arrange** or **modify** or even **delete** the elements of a list (mutable objects) programmatically. The word **programmatically** signifies that the modifications or the updates have been done by the code after the object was created thus meaning **after creation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists, Dictionaries and Sets are **Mutable** objects, meaning you can update or modify the elements from these containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The **\"\\[\\]\"** notation for accessing the elements has nothing to do with the Lists. We can access the values of a container using **\"\\[\\]\"** only!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutability of a List\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are one the most versatile objects in python. They can grow, shrink and update values of the elements. For updating any value from a container, one must access it first!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Lets assume we created a list, xa\n",
    "xa = [\"I'm XA\", \"I'm great!\", 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now we'll be accessing first element from the list\n",
    "xa[0] # This will return \"I'm XA\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers we put in the square brackets are the **index** positions of the elements in the container. Once we're able to access the elements we'll try to modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xa[0] = \"I'm XAMES3 actually\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above means we are updating the value of element on **0th** index position. We can say that we're **updating** or **overwriting** the first value in that list. So when you try to print out the list you'll get the updated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\"I'm XAMES3 actually\", \"I'm great!\", 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutability of a Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries on the other side **do not have indexes** but are considered as Mutable objects, so it means we can **update** or **add/delete** the elements off of a dictionary. Here, the role of the indexes is carried out by the **keys** of the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rest all is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Lets assume we have a dictionary\n",
    "xa = {\"name\": \"XA\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now we want to update the elements here\n",
    "xa[\"age\"] = \"25 years 3 months\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# The output would be {\"name\": \"XA\", \"age\": \"25 years 3 months\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutability of a Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets behave differently when it comes to their mutability. Dictionary and List objects let user to modify the elements but Set **doesn't**! This is because they are an **unordered** collection of unique elements. If they don't have order (index) they can't be accessed using the above mentioned **\"\\[\\]\"** notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since sets don't hold duplicates, but they're considered to be mutable objects meaning because python **updates** or **modifies** the written or created set object (with duplicates) to collection of unique elements (without duplicates). In simple terms python is deleting the duplicates in a set object internally thus sticking to the definition of Mutable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Immutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable Objects are the one which do not let user to modify the elements of the container (**tuple** and **str**). Immutable objects include **str**, **tuple**, **bool**, etc."
