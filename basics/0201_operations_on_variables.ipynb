    "# Operations on Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations on variables in python look like mathematical expressions with some minor differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** All the rules of basic mathematical properties like [**Associative property**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property), [**Commutative property**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property), etc. apply in python too.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are couple of operations that we can do on variables like [**Arithmetic operations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic#Arithmetic_operations), [**Assignments operations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_assignment), [**Comparison operations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator) (Relational operations), Logical operations and Identity-Membership operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arithmetic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic arithmetic operations in python are **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**, **floored division**, **modulus** and **exponential** operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition is the most basic operation of arithmetics.\n",
    "Addition is **commutative** and **associative**, so the order in which terms are added does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This is true only for adding numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 415, 5 # Parallel variable assignment\n",
    "total = first_operand + second_operand # total = 420\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, we can take addition to one step further. Python supports addition of **strings** and **lists**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list_1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "list_2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "total = list_1 + list_2 # total = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] - This is called List Extension.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "str_1 = \"Hello\"\n",
    "str_2 = \"World\"\n",
    "\n",
    "total = str_1 + str_2 # total = \"HelloWorld\" - This is called String Concatenation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can perform addition only on values of **same** type (datatype). Performing addition on variables of different datatype will throw **TypeError**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtraction is **opposite** of Addition. Subtraction is neither **commutative** nor **associative**, so the order in which terms are subtracted does matter alot. Subtraction is only supported by numbers in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 425, 5\n",
    "total = first_operand - second_operand # total = 420\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplication is also **commutative** and **associative** like addition plus it is [**distributive**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 42, 10\n",
    "total = first_operand * second_operand # total = 420\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like Addition, Multiplication can be performed on **strings** and **lists**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list_1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "total = list_1 * 3 # total = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "str_1 = \"Ha\"\n",
    "\n",
    "total = str_1 * 3 # total = \"HaHaHa\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can perform multiplication of **lists** and **strings** with **integers** only.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Division\n",
    "\n",
    "Division is essentially **opposite** of Multiplication. Like Subtraction, Division is also neither **commutative** nor **associative**, so the order in which terms are divided does matter alot. Division is only supported by numbers in python and output of division operation always returns a **float** value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 4200, 10\n",
    "total = first_operand / second_operand # total = 420.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Division returns **Quotient in float**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floored Division\n",
    "\n",
    "Floored Division is just like normal division but this return an **Integral** part of the output value. Means it always returns an **integer** part before the decimal. Floored Division is carried out with **\"//\"** operator in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Normal Division:\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 25, 9\n",
    "total = first_operand / second_operand # total = 2.7777777777777777\n",
    "\n",
    "# Floored Division:\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 25, 9\n",
    "total = first_operand // second_operand # total = 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Floored Division returns **Quotient as integer without rounding-off** the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modulus\n",
    "\n",
    "Modulus or [**Modulo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) operation returns **remainder**. It is carried out using **\"%\"** operator in python. The output of a modulus operation could be either **float** or **integer** depending upon the **type of the operands**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 4200, 10\n",
    "total = first_operand % second_operand # total = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponentiations\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Exponentiation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation) or Powers in python are represented using **\"\\*\\*\"** (double asterisk) operator. Like Modulus, the output of Exponentiation operation could also be either **float** or **integer** depending upon the **type of the operands**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 2, 3\n",
    "total = first_operand ** second_operand # total = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment Operations are carried out using [**Augmented Assignment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_assignment) or **Compound Assignment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An augmented assignment is generally used to replace a statement where an operator takes a variable operates on it and then assigns the result back to the same variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can perform Assignment operations for basic arithmetic operators since this method is a short-hand (shortcut) for writing the arithmetic expression. Also Assignment operations are neither **commutative** nor **associative** so the sequence of operands **does** matter a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Please remember all the execution or operations on objects in python happen from **Right to Left**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we write Addition assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 415, 5\n",
    "first_operand += second_operand # first_operand = 420\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is basically\n",
    "first_operand = first_operand + second_operand\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Please note that the first object (object to the left-hand side) gets assigned with the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtraction Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we write Subtraction assignment. Execution is **similar** to that of Addition Assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 425, 5\n",
    "first_operand -= second_operand # first_operand = 420\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is basically\n",
    "first_operand = first_operand - second_operand\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplication Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we write Multiplication assignment. Again execution is **similar** to that of above assignment methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 42, 10\n",
    "first_operand *= second_operand # first_operand = 420\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is basically\n",
    "first_operand = first_operand * second_operand\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Division Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we write Division assignment. **Similar** execution as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This too will return **float** as output by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 4200, 10\n",
    "first_operand /= second_operand # first_operand = 420.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is basically\n",
    "first_operand = first_operand / second_operand\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floored Division Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we write Floored Division assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 4200.0, 10.0\n",
    "first_operand //= second_operand # first_operand = 420\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is basically\n",
    "first_operand = first_operand // second_operand\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modulus Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we write Modulus assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 420, 10\n",
    "first_operand %= second_operand # first_operand = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is basically\n",
    "first_operand = first_operand % second_operand\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponentiation Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we write Exponentiation assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "first_operand, second_operand = 2, 3\n",
    "first_operand **= second_operand # first_operand = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is basically\n",
    "first_operand = first_operand ** second_operand\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operations or **Relational** operations are carried out to check the **similarities** in python object. These return **boolean** ([**bool**](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/bool.html?highlight=booleans)) and are usually used in **If - Else** conditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more [**here**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator#Sameness_(object_identity)_vs._content_equality). This article will help you understand how, when and why to use **Comparison** Operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "**Equal to** operations are carried out using **\"==\"** (double equal to) operator in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equal to is **commutative**.\n",

    "\n",
    "[**Logical operations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective#Computer_science) are the ones which usually revolves around the concepts of [**Logical Gates**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) in Digital Electronics and kinda works exactly like the same. These are **usually*** used along in the Comparison Operations.\n",
