    "# Variables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are **placeholders** or **pointers** for python objects.<br>This is how we write variables in python, `int_var = 10` or `string_var = \"python string\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `10` is an **integer** ([**int**](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integers)) value stored somewhere in python's [**heap memory**](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html#overview) and **int_var** is the pointer to this integer object and `python string` is the **string** ([**str**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)) value stored somewhere again in python's heap memory and **string_var** is the pointer to this string object. So we casually say it like, **int_var** has value of **10** assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pythonic terms, expressions (statements) or objects like `10` or `python string` are considered to be [**Literals**](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html?highlight=identifier#literals). Basically all **constants** like strings, numbers and booleans are considered as **Literals**. This is because they literally mean exactly what they are whereas, `int_var` and `string_var` are called as [**Identifiers**](https://data-flair.training/blogs/identifiers-in-python/), because they used to identify or find or point to the object's location in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** We'll refer these variables as **Identifiers** going forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restrictions on Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "These identifiers have certain rules or restrictions that a developer must follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The variables must all be **letters**, **digits**, or **underscores** (\"\\_\") and **must start** with a letter.\n",
    "    - It is not mandatory to use combination of letters, digits and an underscore always.\n",
    "    - We can create identifier names with either all letters, prefixed underscores or in combination of all.\n",
    "    - One must remember of starting the identifier name with a letter **always**.\n",
    "    - For example: xa, xames3, xa_mes3, XaMeS3 and \\_xames3 all are considered to be **valid identifier names**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Punctuation and blanks are **not allowed** in variables.\n",
    "    - In case you need to define a longer variable or identifier name, then replace the spaces with underscores.\n",
    "    - For example: long variable name = \"something\" is **syntactically incorrect**.\n",
    "    - To use longer identifier name, replace spaces with underscores like this: **long_variable_name** = \"something\".\n",
    "    - In python, using punctuations (any symbols except underscore) as an identifier name will throw **SyntaxError**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Skip using **reserved** keywords.\n",
    "    - There are some words that are **reserved** for special use in Python. These words are called as [**keywords**](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords). \n",
    "    - Here's a complete list of all the keywords in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        False      await      else       import     pass\n",
    "        None       break      except     in         raise\n",
    "        True       class      finally    is         return\n",
    "        and        continue   for        lambda     try\n",
    "        as         def        from       nonlocal   while\n",
    "        assert     del        global     not        with\n",
    "        async      elif       if         or         yield\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is [**case-sensitive**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity#In_programming_languages) programming language and so are the **identifiers**.\n",
    "    - For example: var, VAR, and VaR are all **different identifiers** or variables.\n",
    "    - Be sure to be consistent with your variables or identifiers through your code to maintain resuability.\n",
    "    - Preferable case for creating identifiers is a [**Snake Case**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meaningful names for variables or identifiers are important for the developers who are looking at your programs, understanding and revising them. This is very important when more than one developer is working on a piece of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Please note that there's difference between keywords and built-in classes. For example: **def** is a keyword and not a class and **str** is a class and not a keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifier Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a [**dynamically**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language) typed language. We don't need to declare variables or identifiers like C, C++. To create an identifier or variable, we just assign a value and then start using it. Assignment is done with a single equal sign (**=**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Augmented Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Like C, python allows something called as [**Augmented Assignment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_assignment) or **Compound Assignment**. \n",
    "\n",
    "An augmented assignment is generally used to replace a statement where an operator takes a variable operates on it and then assigns the result back to the same variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xa += 69 # Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "xa *= 69 # Multiplication\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chained Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows something called as [**Chained Assignment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)#Chained_assignment), which makes it possible to assign the same **value** (object) to multiple variables simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = b = c = 420\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, value of **420** is assigned to all the variables (identifiers) **a**, **b** and **c**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This is a nice and clean way of assigning same object to multiple variables but is little risky as this could potentially affect the values of other variables if not proceeded with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Variable Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Like C, python also allows [**Multiple Variable Assignment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)#Parallel_assignment) or **Parallel Assignment**, which essentially means more than one identifier can be assigned to multiple **literals**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xa, mes3 = \"XA\", \"MES3\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here it means, `xa = \"XA\"` and `mes3 = \"MES3\"` in simple terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Ensure the number of variables on left-hand side is **equal** to number of objects on right-hand side (Currently we're assuming this for variable assignments only). Assigning multiple values to a single identifier on the other hand is going to create a Tuple object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What happens when we assign a value to an identifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write `var_1 = 420`, the [**interpreter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In python, all the statements (expressions) runs from right to left.\n",
    "- First python initializes (creates object in memory) the value of **420** in its memory.\n",
    "- The python interpreter now will try to **analyze** the object.\n",
    "- Once it understands that its an integer object, it will initialize an integer class and then assign the value of **420** to the identifier or variable **var_1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** If you want to check the type of object **var_1** use `type(var_1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking there are 2 types of identifier, **Global** and **Local** identifiers and they operate exactly how they sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "These are referred as [**Public**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_variable#Java) variables in JAVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global variables are the ones which are available globally across your entire python script/file.\n",
    "- They're accessible in your entire python script from any point presuming they're not deleted.\n",
    "- They can be created by prefixing [**global**](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) keyword in a callable object.\n",
    "- Globals should be used **sparingly**! As they have potential of changing the values across your entire python script. Read more [**here**](https://medium.com/better-programming/alternatives-to-using-globals-in-python-a3b2a7d5411b).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "These are referred as **Private** variables in JAVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opposite of Global variable in a sense.\n",
    "- Accessible only in loops and callable objects (Classes OR Functions).\n",
    "- They act like a **private** property or object in a callable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to delete an Identifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting a variable in python is easy. Prefix [**del**](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#del) to a variable name and it gets deleted as simple as that. Ensure that you don't prefix it while writing an expression. Otherwise, it'll throw **SyntaxError**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `del some_variable` is **correct** while `del some_variable = \"some value\"` is **incorrect**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Other ways of deleting an identifier or variable references are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting value as [**None**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html?highlight=none#None) (not really).\n",
    "    - This is one of the misconception that lies around in python.\n",
    "    - You can assign None to an identifier to update the reference to the object.\n",
    "    - Identifier will be now pointing to the newly assigned None object but the previous object may or may not remain in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using class methods (Only for iterables).\n",
    "    - This method is applicable only to **iterators** or **containers**.\n",
    "    - This method relies on understanding the concepts of [**Object Oriented Programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to delete Values?\n",
    "\n",
    "You **don't**!\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create an object and is being used by a program (python script), we can assign or delete multiple references to that object as per our requirements. But when the number of references (pointers pointing) to a particular object becomes **zero**, it is **no longer accessible**!\n",
    "\n",
    "It means the **value** or object stored in the memory is officially **deleted** by python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xa = \"XAMES3\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(id(xa)) # Lets say we got id like this 139635360436592\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create one more reference to the same **\"XAMES3\"** object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xames3 = \"XAMES3\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(id(xames3)) # This will give the same address location 139635360436592\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for some reason we deleted or updated both the identifiers **xa** and **xames3**. This ensures the count of identifiers pointing to the **\"XAMES3\"** has dropped to **0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "del xa # Deleted xa identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "xames3 = \"God-Tier\" # Updated xames3 identifier\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python keeps a track of unused/un-referred objects (**Literals**). And when it feels that the user is not using it, it deletes it so that the occupied memory could be released and could be used for something else. This process is called **\"Garbage Collection\"** in computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we re-create the same **\"XAMES3\"** object and check its **id()** it is going to be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xa = \"XAMES3\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(id(xa)) # This threw 139635360541896\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tip\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of optimization, Python assigns lower memory addresses to values in range of **-5** to **256**. Try it out yourselves!"
